Black Market Brawlers Stats
=======

What is it?
-------
Black Market Brawlers is a webapp encouraged by [Riot API Challenge](https://developer.riotgames.com/discussion/announcements/show/2lxEyIcE). The app allows users to filter and query tens of thousands of League of Legends Black Market Brawlers matches.

What's in it?
--------
This project can be broken down into two parts. The first part is the relatively lengthy collecting and pre-processing of the data. Once this is done, the pre-processed data is ready for the webapp.
The pre-processing scripts can be found [here](https://github.com/KLachhani/RiotAPIChallenge2.0/tree/master/FlaskApp/scripts) , whilst the webapp is found [here](https://github.com/KLachhani/RiotAPIChallenge2.0/tree/master/FlaskApp/FlaskApp).

The webapp can be found at the following address: http://klachhani.com/blackmarketbrawlers
